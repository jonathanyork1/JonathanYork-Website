        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My community has always been placed at the forefront of my work. Beginning in high school, I used my love for people to become a Communications Director, who was the first to experiment with engaging ways to reach peers, faculty, and parents. As a college student at the University of California, Riverside, my mission is to use my platform as a sociology major to further emphasize the importance of connection worldwide. In a professional setting, I have operated in roles that deal with the world first hand as well.  Most recently, an office assistant position required that I clean the storefront, and warehouse, act as a receptionist and aid the scheduling and executive departments. While working with people, I was able to gain computer skills, organizational skills, and much more. Prior to that my primary job was a sales associate. The job required me to provide stellar customer service. Along the way, I picked up other important qualities of a professional, such as the ability to work in a fast paced environment, and how to handle money. 
<br><br>

        My previous occupations are complemented by my efforts on my own time. As a former student of my elementary school, I have become an admissions outreach ambassador, and currently sit on a steering committee devoted to the grand opening of a middle school. Within the committee, I oversee and evaluate how the students are taught and implement teaching methods that allow the students to interact more with their community to help them learn.
In addition, my love for community has always overlapped with my love for music. Since a young age, I have played the piano and sang. I was enrolled in a community arts scholarship program in my middle and high school years that allowed me to grow as a musician and to experiment with dance and theater as well. Following my graduation from the program, and from high school, I have remained an active member of the community arts center and have served in multiple capacities, such as an usher and a music theory instructor. 
As I strive to become a performing musician, I keep my community at heart. Currently, I am in the process of directing a short film that highlights the community in a positive manner and allows different community members to have an outlet to share their stories. 
<br><br>

        No matter what job I take on, I will ensure that I bring my best self, and foster good connections with my colleagues and my customers. Hope to be in touch with you all soon!
